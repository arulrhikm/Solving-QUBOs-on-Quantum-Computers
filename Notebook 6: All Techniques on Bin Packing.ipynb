        "To solve a QUBO problem using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we follow a structured approach inspired by prior work with QAOA. Based on my experience, the most efficient strategy involves converting the PyQUBO model into a Qiskit QuadraticProgram format. This conversion is essential because it allows us to leverage Qiskit's powerful tools for optimization and quantum circuit construction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the QuadraticProgram is obtained, we proceed to build the QAOA circuit by defining several key components, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Custom Cost Hamiltonian: Represents the problem's objective function.\n",
        "*   Mixer Hamiltonian: Facilitates exploration of the solution space.\n",
        "*   Expectation function: Measures the expected outcome of the quantum process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the process of building the QAOA circuit, I also define two key helper functions: get_qp and get_qubo_matrix. While these functions share some overlap with previous QUBO models and with each other, they are essential for ensuring that the QUBO is represented in the appropriate form for QAOA. These dual representations are important because QAOA requires multiple views of the same QUBO model to interact effectively with different parts of the quantum optimization process."

        "## Analysis of Bin Packing Solutions for Small, Medium, and Large Instances\n",
        "We evaluated the performance of various algorithms for solving bin packing problems of different sizes—small, medium, and large. These tests were done seperately to avoid notebook clutter. The results highlight how these methods scale as the problem size increases and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Small Instance Results\n",
        "**Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: ILP found the optimal solution. This configuration was optimal and met all capacity constraints. The solution was computed quickly and accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Brute Force**: Brute force also identified the optimal solution, confirming the correctness of the ILP result. Since the problem was small, brute force performed well, but it’s worth noting that its time complexity grows exponentially, making it impractical for larger instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "**D-Wave Quantum Annealing**: D-Wave produced the same optimal solution as ILP and brute force, demonstrating that the quantum annealer could effectively converge to the best solution for this small problem instance. The quantum annealer was able to handle the problem efficiently and quickly, matching the classical methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**: VQE provided a suboptimal solution with a higher value (less negative) than the optimal solution found by ILP, brute force, and D-Wave. This suggests that VQE had difficulty converging to the best configuration for this instance, potentially due to limitations in its parameter optimization or circuit depth.\n",
        "\n",
        "**QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)**: QAOA performed better than VQE but did not achieve the optimal solution found by ILP or D-Wave. The solution was close to optimal but still slightly off, possibly due to the depth of the quantum circuit or suboptimal parameter choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways for Small Instances:\n",
        "\n",
        "ILP and brute force provide reliable, optimal solutions.\n",
        "D-Wave demonstrated the potential of quantum annealing to solve small combinatorial problems optimally and efficiently.\n",
        "VQE and QAOA performed less optimally, potentially due to issues with parameter optimization, circuit depth, or noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Medium Instance Results\n",
        "**Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: ILP was able to find the optimal solution, though it took longer than for the small instance. As the number of items increased, ILP required more processing time, but it still produced an optimal configuration and met all capacity constraints in a reasonable time frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Brute Force**: Brute force was still able to find the optimal solution, but it became noticeably slower as the problem size grew. The exponential time complexity of brute force made it less practical for medium-sized problems, although it was still usable for this instance. The increased computation time highlighted the scalability issues of brute force.\n",
        "\n",
        "**D-Wave Quantum Annealing**: D-Wave continued to perform well for the medium-sized instance, providing an optimal solution in a faster time than brute force and ILP. The quantum annealer demonstrated its efficiency at this scale, handling the increased complexity without running into memory issues or excessive computation times.\n",
        "\n",
        "**VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**: VQE showed some improvement over the small instance, but it still struggled to reach the optimal solution. The solution was close but had a higher value than the ILP result, indicating that VQE was unable to find the best configuration. The faster convergence compared to the small instance was a sign of progress, but more refinement in the algorithm was needed for reliable optimal results at this scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "**QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)**: QAOA performed better than VQE in this case, providing a solution that was closer to optimal. It outperformed VQE in terms of solution quality and speed, although it still did not achieve the optimal solution. QAOA benefited from a better circuit depth or parameter setup compared to the small case but was still an approximate method and could not guarantee optimal results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways for Medium Instances:\n",
        "\n",
        "ILP and brute force still provide optimal solutions, though brute force is less practical due to increased computation time.\n",
        "D-Wave proved to be an efficient method, solving the problem quickly while maintaining accuracy.\n",
        "VQE and QAOA performed better than in the small instance, with QAOA performing closer to optimal. However, both still struggled to guarantee optimal solutions, indicating that further optimization and deeper circuits may be needed for larger medium-sized problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Large Instance Results\n",
        "**Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**: ILP was able to find the optimal solution, but the time required to process the larger instance grew significantly. While ILP can guarantee an optimal solution, the computational resources and time required to solve large instances become a limitation. The solver still produced correct solutions, but as the problem size grows, the time required for solution increases dramatically due to the exponential complexity of solving linear programming problems with many variables and constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Brute Force**: Brute force, while guaranteed to find the optimal solution, took an excessive amount of time due to the exponential growth in the number of combinations that needed to be evaluated. The time required to complete the solution made brute force impractical for large instances, highlighting the scalability challenges of this method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)**: VQE encountered a memory error during execution, likely due to the complexity of the problem. The memory required to store the quantum state space and process the Hamiltonian grew exponentially with the number of qubits, causing the algorithm to fail for larger instances. This points to the need for further development in quantum algorithms to handle larger problem spaces efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)**: QAOA also encountered a memory error, similar to VQE. The increasing complexity of the quantum circuit required too many resources, and the backend could not handle the computation. This suggests that the circuit complexity was too high for the available resources, limiting the performance of QAOA on large instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "**D-Wave Quantum Annealing**: D-Wave was the only method that successfully found an optimal solution. It did so efficiently, without encountering memory issues or excessive computation times. The quantum annealer was able to handle the larger problem instance, showcasing its scalability and resource efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems at large scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "In summary, D-Wave quantum annealing emerged as the most robust and scalable solution, effectively handling both small and large bin packing problems, while classical methods like ILP and Brute Force were reliable for smaller instances but faced scalability issues. Quantum methods like VQE and QAOA demonstrated potential but are not yet capable of consistently solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems without further refinement."
